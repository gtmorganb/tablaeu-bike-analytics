For this Citi Bike Analysis, I used the data from the second half of 2020 to perform the analysis. 

The first thing I did was count up how many bike rides there were per month from July 2020-December 2020. 
September had the most rides, followed by October then August. This makes sense because New York has really hot summers and cold winters so the fall would have more temperate months. 

I wanted to see which Start and End stations were the most and least popular. The top ten start and end stations had several in common. This is not surprising because many people frequent the same areas. One of the unexpected phenomena I found is that the bottom ten start and bottom ten end stations only had one station in common between them. This means that there are 9 stations that people don't use for getting on and a separate nine stations people do not frequent for ending their right. This can be seen in the dashboard labeled, "Bottom Stations Dash". 

I was curious if certain bikes got used more than others. The bike with the most usage has 1822 rides whereas the bike with the least amount of rides (aside from 0 rides) has 3. This was unexpected because I would suspect that for maintenance purposes bikes would be rotated among stations with varying popularity. This can be seen on the Bike Usage sheet. 

I was curious about the Citi Bike usage and the data came back different than I predicted. I assumed most of the ridership would be tourists or people who have not subscribed (i.e. pay for one ride and leave), however, 75% of the ridership came from subscribers. This can be seen on the sheet Customer or Subscriber. 

The second unexpected phenomena was the birth year of the most riders. In the Demographics Dashboard, you can see that the most common birth year for riders from July-December 2020 was 1969 which would make the riders between the age of 50-51 depending on their age. I would have assume the largest age group for ridership would be somewhere between 25-35 (birth years 1985-1995). The second most common birth year does fall within that range and is 1990. 

The City Official Map shows the start ride locations that are color and size scaled by popularity.
